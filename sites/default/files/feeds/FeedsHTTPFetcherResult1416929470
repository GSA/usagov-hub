"Requisitos legales y consejos básicos para redactar un testamento","Encuentre información básica sobre testamentos.","Existen leyes e impuestos relacionados a la transferencia de bienes. Por lo tanto, si usted está preparando un testamento es conveniente contar con asesoría legal, particularmente cuando se trata de comprender todas las reglamentaciones que rigen el proceso de disposición de la herencia en su estado.
Tenga en cuenta los requisitos legales y los siguientes consejos:
En la mayoría de los estados, es necesario tener 18 años de edad o más.
Para que un testamento sea válido, el testador debe gozar de sano juicio y plena facultad mental.
El testamento debe declarar con claridad que es su voluntad.
Debe nombrar un albacea que haga cumplir su testamento y se asegure de que su herencia sea distribuida de acuerdo con sus deseos.
No es necesario legalizar, ni inscribir su testamento, pero hacerlo podría protegerlo contra demandas sobre su validez. Para que sea válido, usted debe firmar el testamento en presencia de al menos dos testigos.
Si se trata de activos financieros siempre se respetará un testamento financiero por sobre otro testamento.
La redacción de un testamento puede ser tan simple como escribir una carta en la cual usted indica cómo desea que sus bienes sean transferidos a seres queridos u organizaciones caritativas después de su fallecimiento. Al escribir su testamento, usted tiene que decidir a quién dejará sus bienes para indicar quiénes son sus beneficiarios primarios y secundarios. 
Si usted no cuenta con un testamento al morir, su herencia será manejada de acuerdo con las leyes del estado donde usted reside y su propiedad podría ser distribuida de un modo diferente al que usted desearía.

"El Seguro Social y su jubilación","Tenga en cuenta estos tres aspectos al planificar su jubilación.","Los beneficios del Seguro Social componen gran parte de la cartera de jubilación de muchas personas. Al planificar sus ahorros e inversiones para la tercera edad, tenga en cuenta los siguientes aspectos sobre los beneficios del Seguro Social:
1. Edad para jubilarse
Para jubilarse y solicitar los beneficios del Seguro Social, usted debe tener al menos 62 años. Sin embargo, a esa edad recibirá sus beneficios reducidos para siempre. Si por el contrario decide jubilarse a los 67 años, obtendrá sus beneficios completos.
Consulte el planificador de beneficios por jubilación del Seguro Social para obtener información detallada.
2. Créditos necesarios para jubilarse
Además de contar con la edad reglamentaria, usted debe acumular un total de 40 créditos para poder jubilarse. Los créditos que acumula dependen de la cantidad de años que trabajó. En términos generales, recibe cuatro créditos por cada año de trabajo.
Si ya acumuló 40 créditos y desea saber la cantidad de dinero que le corresponde por jubilación, puede crear en Internet su cuenta del Seguro Social (en inglés) para recibir una copia del estado de cuenta de sus beneficios.
Si aún no cuenta con los 40 créditos necesarios pero desea obtener un monto estimado de los beneficios que obtendrá, puede utilizar la calculadora de beneficios de jubilación.
3. Retiro en el extranjero
Usted tiene derecho a recibir los beneficios del Seguro Social donde decida jubilarse, así sea en otro país.
Existen ciertos reglamentos para los ciudadanos, los residentes de Estados Unidos y las personas que viven en Cuba, Corea del Norte y otros países. Si actualmente recibe una pensión de jubilación de otro país que no sea Estados Unidos, puede que el Seguro Social le reduzca sus beneficios. Obtenga más información sobre sus pagos mientras está fuera de Estados Unidos (PDF).
Solicitud de beneficios por jubilación e información general
Puede presentar su solicitud de beneficios por jubilación vía Internet o en las oficinas del Seguro Social. Usted puede encontrar la oficina más cercana a su localidad (en inglés).
Si desea obtener más información, comuníquese con el Seguro Social al 1-800-772-1213 (presione 7 para español) o al 1-800-325-0778 (TTY, para personas con discapacidad auditiva).

"Inversiones protegidas por el Gobierno","Sepa cuáles son sus opciones de inversión favorecidas por el Gobierno.","Existen muchas opciones para invertir su dinero, pero tenga en cuenta que mientras mayor sea el potencial de ganancias, mayor será el riesgo. El Gobierno federal respalda solamente los valores del Tesoro de Estados Unidos. Es decir, los productos derivados de las obligaciones de deuda emitidas por el Gobierno estadounidense. Los bonos y fondos de bonos del Gobierno son considerados como opciones de inversión de bajo riesgo. También son conocidos como títulos de renta fija porque la renta que pagan se fija al momento de la venta.  
¿Tienen ventajas impositivas ciertas inversiones? 
Los Bonos de Ahorro del Tesoro de Estados Unidos están exentos de impuestos locales y estatales.
Los bonos municipales están exentos del impuesto federal a las ganancias y, a veces, también del impuesto estatal a las ganancias.
Para algunos objetivos especiales, como el pago de estudios universitarios y jubilación, existen inversiones con impuestos aplazados que le permiten posponer o incluso eliminar el pago de impuestos a las ganancias. 
Autoridades del Gobierno en el mundo de las inversiones
La Comisión de Bolsa y Valores (SEC, sigla en inglés) exige que las compañías públicas den a conocer su información financiera y otros datos necesarios para ayudarlo a tomar decisiones. Puede encontrar información por empresa en la base de datos de la SEC (en inglés). Usted también puede llamar gratis al 1-877-732-0330 para obtener material gratuito y alertas de inversión o para saber cómo presentar una queja.

"How the U.S. Government Is Organized","Learn how the U.S. federal government is organized.","The Constitution of the United States divides the federal government into three branches to ensure a central government in which no individual or group gains too much control:
Legislative – Makes laws (Congress)
Executive – Carries out laws (President, Vice President, Cabinet)
Judicial – Evaluates laws (Supreme Court and Other Courts)
Each branch of government can change acts of the other branches as follows:
The president can veto laws passed by Congress.
Congress confirms or rejects the president's appointments and can remove the president from office in exceptional circumstances.
The justices of the Supreme Court, who can overturn unconstitutional laws, are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
The U.S. federal government seeks to act in the best interests of its citizens through this system of checks and balances.
Legislative Branch
The legislative branch enacts legislation, confirms or rejects presidential appointments, and has the authority to declare war.
This branch includes Congress (the Senate and House of Representatives) and several agencies that provide support services to Congress. American citizens have the right to vote for senators and representatives through free, confidential ballots.
Senate - There are two elected senators per state, totaling 100 senators. A senate term is six years and there's no limit to the number of terms an individual can serve.
House of Representatives - There are 435 elected representatives, which are divided among the 50 states in proportion to their total population. There are additional non-voting delegates who represent the District of Columbia and the territories. A representative serves a two-year term, and there's no limit to the number of terms an individual can serve.
Executive Branch
The executive branch carries out and enforces laws. It includes the president, vice president, the Cabinet, executive departments, independent agencies, and other boards, commissions, and committees.
American citizens have the right to vote for the president and vice president through free, confidential ballots.
Key roles of the executive branch include:
President - The president leads the country. He/she is the head of state, leader of the federal government, and commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The president serves a four-year term and can be elected no more than two times.
Vice President - The vice president supports the president. If the president is unable to serve, the vice president becomes president. He/she can serve an unlimited number of four-year terms.
The Cabinet - Cabinet members serve as advisors to the president. They include the vice president and the heads of executive departments. Cabinet members are nominated by the president and must be approved by the Senate (with at least 51 votes).
Judicial Branch
The judicial branch interprets the meaning of laws, applies laws to individual cases, and decides if laws violate the Constitution.
The judicial branch is comprised of the Supreme Court and other federal courts.
Supreme Court - The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. The justices of the Supreme Court are nominated by the president and must be approved by the Senate (with at least 51 votes). Congress decides the number of justices. Currently, there are nine. There is no fixed term for justices. They serve until their death, retirement, or removal in exceptional circumstances.
Other Federal Courts - The Constitution grants Congress the authority to establish other federal courts.

"Pension Benefits","Most traditional private pension plans are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.","If you work for, or retired from, a job with a traditional pension plan, the benefits you've earned will be paid to you even if the company runs into financial problems.  
That's where the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) comes in. This government agency insures most private-sector defined-benefit pensions that typically pay a certain amount each month after you retire.
PBGC does not cover government and military pensions, 401Ks, IRAs and other certain plans.
PBGC does cover most cash-balance plans, a type of defined-benefit pension that allows you to take a lump-sum distribution.
How Your Guaranteed Pension Works
If your plan is insured by PBGC and it ends without enough money to pay all benefits, PBGC will pay you the money you’re owed, up to legal limits.
The money comes from companies whose plans are covered, from the assets of failed plans, and from PBGC’s investments. It does not come from taxes.
Even if your employer doesn’t pay required premiums, your insured plan stays insured.
Read these frequently asked questions about pension plan terminations and how your guaranteed pension works.
Find an Unclaimed Pension
More than 38 million people in the U.S. haven’t claimed pension benefits they have earned.

"President of the United States of America","Learn more about the requirements to be President, election process, inauguration, State of the Union address and how to contact the White House.","The President of the United States is the head of state of the U.S., the chief executive of the federal government, and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. The United States was the first nation to create the office of President as the head of state in a modern republic.
Requirements to Hold Office - Section One of Article II of the U.S. Constitution
The President must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a resident of the United States for 14 years.
State of the Union Address - 2014
The Constitution requires the President to give Congress a State of the Union, which is a report that addresses a President's legislative proposals and other plans for the country. There is no requirement stating what form or how often the report occurs; however, it normally occurs annually in the last week of January.
Presidential Election Process
The election process begins with the primary elections, during which political parties each select a nominee to unite behind; the nominee in turn selects a Vice Presidential running mate. The candidates then face off in the general election, usually participating in debates and campaigns across the country to explain their views and plans to the voters.
An election occurs every four years. Unlike other political elections, presidential elections use theElectoral College. The President and the Vice President are the only two nationally elected officials in the United States. To win election, a candidate must receive a majority of electoral votes, or if no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives and Senate choose the President and Vice President.
Inauguration Day
Inauguration Day occurs every four years on January 20 at the U.S. Capitol in our nation's capital of Washington, DC.  The inauguration is when the President-elect and Vice President-elect are sworn in and take office. During the inaugural ceremony, each President recites the following oath, in accordance with Article II, Section I of the U.S. Constitution:
""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""
The Inauguration is planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.   Nine common activities typically occur:

"File a Complaint about Federal Government Contracts","Learn how to remedy contract disputes and file complaints regarding contract award, discrimination or misuse of federal funds.","There are many government contracting regulations in place that provide alternatives when issues occur, including disputes and protests. 
Disputes
The contracting officer (CO) assigned to a specific contract must first address any questions about the terms and conditions of that contract. If there is a disagreement between the CO and the contractor based on different interpretations of a contract, the contract itself will offer information on how to resolve disputes. Disputes are issues or disagreements between the contractor and contracting officer that arise after contract award. Disputes claims must be made in writing to the contracting officer. 
Bid Protests
Protests are made when you want to challenge the award or proposed award of a contract for procurement of goods and services or challenge the terms of a solicitation for a contract. It is always preferable to resolve issues at the contracting agency level. If not resolved, you can file a bid protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). Keep in mind, there are strict filing deadlines and regulations regarding protests. 
Discrimination Complaint
If you have a complaint about employment discrimination associated with a federal government contract, you can file a discrimination complaint or contact your regional or district office of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).

"Register for the Draft with the Selective Service System","Most men 18-25 who are U.S. citizens or are living in the U.S. must register for the draft with the Selective Service System.","A draft is the mandatory enrollment of individuals into the armed forces. Although the United States military has been an all-volunteer force since 1973, the government maintains the ability to start a draft in case of a national emergency. The Selective Service System is the agency responsible for the draft.
Who Must Register for the Draft
Almost all men 18-25 who are U.S. citizens or are immigrants living in the U.S. are required to register with Selective Service.
Men in the U.S. on student, visitor or diplomatic visas and women are not required to register. For other exemptions, see the Who Must Register (PDF) chart.
How to Register
Register online or print out the form and mail it.
What Happens After You Register
Nothing happens unless there’s a crisis requiring a draft.
If there was a draft:
Men would be called in sequence determined by random lottery number and year of birth.
They would be examined for mental, physical and moral fitness by the military.
They would either be deferred or exempted from military service or inducted into the Armed Forces.
What Happens If You Don’t Register
If you are required to register and you don’t, you will not be eligible for federal student aid, federal job training, a federal job, or U.S. citizenship. You may be prosecuted and face a stiff fine and/or jail time.

"Export Licenses ","How can an export license","What is an export license?
An export license is a government document that authorizes the export of certain controlled goods and the export of non-controlled goods to a handful of countries that are under U.S. government sanctions.
Does your office cover all export and export licenses?
No. The Department of Commerce regulates most of the export and re-export of most commercial goods. The Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Control regulates defense articles and services. Some products or a component of a product that might be exported can be classified as “dual use,” meaning they can be used both commercially and have defense applications.
If you think your product might be dual use, you will need to talk with one of our Trade Specialists. Refer call to Tier2.
How do I find out if I need a license from the Department of Commerce to export my product/service?
Ninety-five percent of all goods exported from the U.S. do not require a license. To find out if your product requires an export license from the Department of Commerce, you’ll need to research the Commerce Control List or CCL found in the Export Administration Regulations to see if your product has an Export Control Classification Number or ECCN. If your product is not in the CCL, then it will be designated as EAR99, which is a bucket list of all other commercial items. You can find the CCL at http://www.bis.doc.gov/. Once on the website, select the Licensing tab, and then the Commerce Control List (CCL) link.   
For more information, please call the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security Office of Exporter Services at 1-202-482-4811. 
Note:  If the caller knows the product needs a license but does not fall under the Department of Commerce, look in USA.gov FAQs/KB under “exporting.”

"Duties and Taxes ","Find out what duties or taxes are needed to clear customs.","What is a tariff or duty?
A tariff or duty (the words are used interchangeably) is a tax levied by governments on the value including freight and insurance of imported products. Different countries apply different tariffs on different products. Governments will often charge national sales and local taxes, and in some instances customs fees, in addition to the tariff. Governments collect the tariff, along with the other assessments, at the time of customs clearance in the foreign port. Tariffs and taxes increase the cost of your product to the foreign buyer and may affect your competitiveness in the market. So knowing what the final cost to your buyer is can help you price your product for that market. In addition, your buyer may ask you to quote an estimate of these costs before making the purchase. You can make this estimate via e-mail, phone, or in the pro forma invoice (PDF, 1555KB, download Adobe Reader).
You can refer callers to a video on Computing Duties and Taxes.
What are the taxes and duties to export my product to (country)?
To find the duty and tax rate for your product, you must first know the product classification number, which may be referred to as the Schedule B or HS number. Once you know your Schedule B number you can register for the online tariff search database. To find out how to register and use the duty and tariff online tool, visit Export.gov, then select the Solutions tab, then International Logistics, and select the Tariffs and Import Fees link.
Can I confirm /verify the exact cost of my tax and duties online?
The duty and taxes listed online are estimates based on the information input. The exact cost will not be determined until the products are received and cleared in customs at a foreign port.

Countries use the certificates of origin for FTAs to qualify products for tariff rate reduction or elimination when exported to countries extending these benefits, such as Canada and Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA.

"Free Trade Agreements ","Find information about Free Trade Agreements.","Note: Refer callers with specific questions about Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to a Tier 2 Trade Specialist.
What is a Free Trade Agreement or FTA?
A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is an agreement between two or more countries where the countries agree on certain obligations that affect trade in goods and services, and protections for investors and intellectual property rights, among other topics. For the United States, the main goal of trade agreements is to reduce barriers to U.S. exports, protect U.S. interests competing abroad, and enhance the rule of law in the FTA partner country or countries. The reduction of trade barriers and the creation of a more stable and transparent trading and investment environment make it easier and cheaper for U.S. companies to export their products and services to trading partner markets.
The United States has 14 Free Trade Agreements in force with 20 countries.
What is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and how does it help my business?
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) eliminated all tariffs and quotas on U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada as of January 1, 2008. NAFTA created the world’s largest free trade area, which links 454 million people producing over $17.2 trillion worth of goods and services in 2010. The dismantling of trade barriers and the opening of markets has led to economic growth and rising prosperity in all three countries.
An exporter of NAFTA qualified products or their agent must first determine if the product was manufactured in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico and then whether they have documentation detailing how the items were produced. You only need a NAFTA certificate of origin when you want to claim NAFTA preferential duty rates and the goods qualify because they contain sufficient North American content.
To learn more about NAFTA, the rules of origin, how to complete Certificates of Origin and more, visit Export.gov and select the Opportunities tab, then Free Trade Agreements, and click on the NAFTA link. 
My customer is asking me for a certificate of origin. How do I fill it out?
To learn more about the NAFTA certificate of origin and how to fill it out, visit Export.gov. Select the Opportunities tab, then Free Trade Agreements, and click on the NAFTA link. Once on the NAFTA page, select the link for Documenting Origin. Here you will find detailed information and two videos that are very helpful in this process.
If other than NAFTA COO, refer to Tier 2.
How do I find information on other Free Trade Agreements?

"American Money","Understand the basics of U.S.currency.","The United States issues paper currency and coins to pay for purchases, taxes, and debts.
Paper Money
American paper currency is issued in several denominations: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing manufactures paper money. It also redesigns money, with new appearances and enhanced security features to prevent counterfeiting. You can purchase commemorative or bulk versions of American currency through the Bureau's Money Store.
The United States no longer issues bills in larger denominations, such as $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 bills. However, they are still legal tender and may still be in circulation. 
Coins
The United States issues several denominations, with the most common being: 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢, and $1. The U.S. Mint is responsible for manufacturing and circulating coins to pay for goods and services. It also issues collectible and commemorative coins that honor a person, place, or event and are available for purchase.
Mutilated Money
If you have paper money that is extremely damaged, you can redeem it with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Examples of damaged paper money include bills that are less than one half of the bill, or in such a condition that you are unable to tell the denomination of the bill. If you have paper money that is dirty, defaced, torn, or more than half of the original size, you can take it to your local bank to exchange if for a bill that is in better shape.
If you have any coins that are fused, melted, or mutilated in any other way, you can send them to the U.S. Mint for evaluation. You can exchange other coins that aren't severely damaged at your local bank.

Treasury Bills—Short term securites that mature between a few days and 52 weeks.
Treasury Notes—Medium term securites that mature between one and 10 years.
Treasury Bonds—Long term securities, with a 30 year term that pays interest every six months, until the bond matures.
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)—Securities with principle values that adjust based on inflation, but with fixed interest rates for five, 10, or 30 year maturities.
Savings Bonds—Securities that offer a fixed interest rate over a fixed period of time.

"ATM and Debit Cards","Understand how to use debit and ATM cards, and protections for lost or stolen cards.","Debit and automated teller machine (ATM) cards let you electronically transfer money from your bank account. With a debit card and personal identification number (PIN), you can use an ATM to withdraw cash, make deposits, or transfer funds between accounts. Some ATMs charge a fee if you are not a member of the ATM network or are making a transaction at a remote location.
Retail purchases can also be made with a debit card. You can either enter your PIN or sign for the purchase. Although a debit card looks like a credit card, where you pay the card issuer at some time in the future, the money for a debit card purchase is transferred immediately from your bank account to the store’s account. When you use a debit card, federal law does not give you the right to stop payment; you must resolve problems directly with the seller.
Lost or Stolen Cards
If you suspect your debit card has been lost or stolen, call the card issuer immediately. While federal law limits your liability for a lost or stolen credit card to $50, your liability for unauthorized use of your ATM or debit card can be much greater, depending on how quickly you report the loss.
If you report a debit or ATM card missing before it is used, you are not responsible for any unauthorized withdrawals.
Your liability is limited to $50 if you report the loss within two business days after you realize your ATM or debit card is missing, and increases to $500 if you report the loss between two and 60 days.
If you have not reported an unauthorized use of a debit or ATM card within 60 days after your bank mails the statement documenting the unauthorized use, you could lose all of the money in your bank account as well as the unused portion of your line of credit established for overdrafts.
Check the policies of your card issuer; some offer more generous limits on a voluntary basis.

"Pyramid Schemes","Understand what pyramid schemes are, how to avoid being a victim, and where to file a complaint.","A pyramid scheme, also known as Ponzi scheme, is an illegal form of multilevel marketing. In these programs, your ability to earn profits is based on the number of new participants you recruit, instead of the amount of products or services you sell. Sometimes there actually aren't any real products that are being sold. These types of schemes are common with investment and independent direct selling opportunities.
These schemes rely on the income from new participants in order to pay fake ""profits"" to people that have been part of the scheme for longer amounts of time. However, the scheme falls apart when there aren't enough new recruits to pay into the system, so the earlier participants no longer receive earnings.
Tips to Avoid Being a Victim
You can take steps to prevent yourself from getting involved in a pyramid scheme:
Be wary of ""opportunities"" to invest your money in franchises or investments that require you to bring in more investors to increase your profit, or recoup your initial investment.
Independently verify the legitimacy of any franchise or investment with the Bettter Business Bureau, your state Attorney General, or any licensing agencies.
Be skeptical of success stories and testimonials of fantastic earnings.
File a Complaint
If you've been the victim of a pyramid scheme, contact your state consumer protection office, state Attorney General, or the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to file a complaint. If the pyramid scheme involved securities, you should also file a complaint with your state's securities administrator, or the Securities and Exchange Commission.

"Phishing and Vishing","Understand how phishing and vishing scams work and how to protect yourself from them.","Phishing is a scam in which you receive a fraudulent e-mail designed to steal your identity or vital personal information, such as credit card numbers, bank account numbers, debit card PINs, and passwords. A phishing e-mail often asks you to verify this type of information. The e-mail may state that your account has been compromised or that one of your accounts was charged incorrectly, but you must click on a link in the e-mail or reply with your bank account number to confirm your identiy or protect your account.
Legitimate companies never ask for your password or account number via e-mail. The e-mail may even threaten to disable your account, if you don't reply, but don't believe it. If you receive an e-mail there are several actions you should take:
Don't click on any links in the e-mail. They can contain a virus that can harm your computer. Even if links in the e-mail say the name of the company, don't trust them. They may redirect to a fraudulent website.
Don't reply to the e-mail itself. Instead forward the e-mail to the Federal Trade Commission at spam@uce.gov.
If you believe that the e-mail is valid, contact the company using the phone numbers, listed on your statements or in the phone book. Tell the customer service representative about the e-mail and ask if your account has been compromised. You can also contact the company online by typing the company's web address directly into the address bar; never use the links to provided in the e-mail.
If you clicked on any links in the phishing e-mail or replied with the requested personal information, contact your bank directly to let them know and ask to have fraud alerts placed on your accounts, have new credit cards issued, or set new passwords.
Vishing
Similar to phishing, vishing scammers also seek to get you to provide your personal information. However, instead of using e-mail to request the information, vishing scammers use the phone to make their requests. You may be directed to call a phone number to verify an account or to reactivate a debit or credit card. If you have received one of these calls, report it to the Internet Crime Complaint Center.

State primaries occur through a secret ballot. There are two types of primaries: closed and open. During a closed primary, you can vote only for a candidate belonging to the same political party as you. During an open primary, you can vote for a candidate of any political party.
Caucuses are meetings where members of political parties divide themselves into groups according to the candidate they support, with undecided voters forming into a group of their own. Each group then gives speeches supporting a candidate and tries to persuade others to join their group. At the end of the caucus, party organizers count the voters in each candidate's group and calculate how many delegates each candidate has won.
When the primaries and caucuses are over, most political parties hold a national convention where the winning candidate receives a nomination.

"Flood Insurance","Learn about flood insurance, the National Flood Insurance Program, and where to purchase flood insurance. ","Flood insurance protects you and your property from losses due to flooding. Flood insurance is available for homes as well as for businesses. Homeowner's and renter's insurance policies do not typically cover flood damage, so you will need to purchase a separate flood policy if you would like to protect yourself from this risk. The cost of a flood insurance policy depends on how much insurance you purchase, the year that the building was constructed, the property's flood risk, and other factors. There may also be a difference in costs depending on if you own a house or condo, or rent your home. You may choose to buy building coverage, which covers the actual home you live in, contents coverage to protect the items in your home, or both.
In order for the damage to be covered, it must be a direct result of the flooding. There may also be a waiting period from the date you bought your policy before it goes into effect.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The federal government's National Flood Insurance Program helps to protect you from flood damage. If you live in a participating community, the NFIP allows you to buy flood insurance based on agreements reached between your local community and the federal government. Like other types of insurance policies, you would still buy your policy from an insurance agent, not directly from the federal government.

"Reverse Mortgages","Find out what a reverse mortgage is, what types are available, and what to watch out for.","A reverse mortgage is a home loan that you do not have to pay back for as long as you live in your home. You only repay the loan when you die, sell your home, or permanently move away. Homeowners who are at least 62 years old are eligible. These mortgages allow older homeowners to convert part of the equity in their homes into cash without having to sell their homes or take on additional monthly bills.
Read more information about reverse mortgages.
Types of reverse mortgages include:
Federally insured Reverse Mortgages - Known as Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM)
Proprietary Reverse Mortgages
Single Purpose Reverse Mortgages
Be sure to watch for aggressive lending practices, advertisements that refer to the loan as ""free money,"" or those that fail to disclose fees or terms of the loan. To be a savvy consumer and help protect yourself, remember:
Do not respond to unsolicited advertisements
Be suspicious of anyone claiming that you can own a home with no down payment
Seek out your own reverse mortgage counselor
Never sign anything you do not fully understand
Make sure the loan is federally insured
Reporting Fraud or Abuse
If you suspect fraud or abuse, let the counselor, lender, or loan servicer know. You may also file a complaint:
Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
State Attorney General's office
State banking authority
If you have questions, contact your local Homeownership Center for advice.

"Préstamo hipotecario","Qué hacer antes de adquirir un préstamo hipotecario.","Si compara entre distintos préstamos para el hogar o hipotecas, podrá obtener el mejor financiamiento. Una hipoteca, sea para la compra de una vivienda, un refinanciamiento o un préstamo sobre el valor acumulado de la vivienda, es un producto cuyo precio y condiciones pueden ser negociables. Buscar, comparar y negociar pueden ahorrarle miles de dólares.
Antes de adquirir un préstamo hipotecario:
Investigue las tasas de interés actuales. Consulte la sección de bienes raíces de su periódico local, utilice los servicios de Internet o llame al menos a seis entidades de préstamo para obtener información.
Verifique las tasas correspondientes a hipotecas de 30, 20 y 15 años. Usted puede ahorrar miles de dólares en cargos por concepto de intereses, obteniendo el préstamo hipotecario al menor plazo que pueda solventar.
Pida información a varias instituciones financieras para comparar iguales cantidades, plazos y tipos de préstamos. Asegúrese de obtener las diferentes tasas de interés anual, con o sin el uso de puntos para adquirir una tasa más baja. También tenga en cuenta los honorarios de los agentes y otros gastos.
Averigüe si la tasa es fija o ajustable. La tasa de interés en los préstamos hipotecarios de tasa ajustable puede variar mucho a lo largo del periodo hipotecario. Un aumento de muchos puntos porcentuales puede elevar los pagos en cientos de dólares al mes. Si un préstamo tiene una tasa ajustable, pregunte cuándo y cómo podría cambiar los términos de pago.
Averigüe a cuánto asciende el pago inicial. Algunas entidades de préstamo exigen un 20 % del precio de compra de la casa como pago inicial. Sin embargo, muchas entidades ofrecen actualmente préstamos que requieren una suma menor. En estos casos, se le puede solicitar que compre un seguro hipotecario privado (PMI, sigla en inglés) para proteger a la entidad de préstamo en caso que usted se atrase en los pagos.
Si se requiere un seguro hipotecario privado, averigüe el costo total del seguro. ¿A cuánto ascenderá el pago mensual de la hipoteca al añadirse el pago periódico de este tipo de seguro y por cuánto tiempo tendrá que mantenerlo?
Pregunte si puede pagar el préstamo por adelantado y si existe alguna penalización en tal caso.
Usted puede encontrar una larga lista de proveedores de préstamos hipotecarios: bancos hipotecarios, corredores de hipotecas, bancos, entidades de ahorro y préstamo, cooperativas de crédito, constructores, agencias de bienes raíces y entidades crediticias por Internet. Al considerar entre las opciones, puede utlizar una hoja de cálculo de la Corporación Federal de Seguro de Depósitos (FDIC, sigla en inglés) para evaluar los costos y cómo se comparan entre instituciones financieras.

"Credit Card Laws Protecting You","Understand credit card laws designed to protect consumers.","If you use credit cards, laws are designed to protect you from credit card companies' unfair practices and to help you resolve problems.
Fairness and Transparency under the Credit CARD Act
The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) is designed to:
Prohibit certain practices that are unfair or abusive, such as hiking up the rate on an existing balance, or allowing you to go overlimit and then imposing an overlimit fee.
Make the rates and fees on credit cards more transparent so that you can understand how much you are paying for your credit card.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) offers more information about the Credit CARD Act.
Disputing a Credit Card Charge under the Fair Credit Billing Act
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you have the right to dispute charges on your credit card that you did not make or are incorrect, or for goods or services that you did not receive.
Send a letter to the creditor within 60 days of the postmark of the bill with the with disputed charge.
Include your name and account number, the date and amount of the disputed charge, and a complete explanation of why you are disputing the charge.
To ensure it is received, send your letter by certified mail, with a return receipt requested.
The creditor or card issuer must acknowledge your letter in writing within 30 days of receiving it and conduct an investigation within 90 days. You do not have to pay the amount in dispute during the investigation.
If there was an error, the creditor must credit your account and remove any fees.
If the bill is correct, you must be told in writing what you owe and why. You must pay it along with any related finance charges.
If you do not agree with the creditor's decision, file an appeal with CFPB.

"Protect Yourself Against Fraud","Tips to protect against fraud, and information on how to file a complaint.","Scam artists use different types of fraud to try to trick people out of their money. Two common types of fraud are banking scams and investment scams.
Banking Scams
Popular banking scams include:
fake check scams, where a scam artist creates counterfeit checks that look legitimate, with watermarks, routing numbers, and the names of real financial institutions. They then try to deposit them in banks, use them as part of other frauds against consumers, or use them to pay companies for products or services. 
unsolicited check fraud, where a scammer may send you a check that you didn't have a legitimate reason to receive. Unfortunately, if you cash it, you may be authorizing the purchase of items you didn't ask for, signing up for a loan, or something else you didn't ask for. The Federal Trade Commission offers tips to help you avoid being a victim of these scams, and recommends what to do if you have been a victim.

"Government Sales and Auctions","Learn which government agencies auction surplus or forfeited items to the public and things to know before you bid.","Several government agencies sell items to the public through both live and online auctions. These auctions, especially online ones, let you purchase government owned assets, across the country and U.S. owned territories. Agencies sell many types of items, including:
aircraft
antiques
art
clothing
collectibles
commercial equipment
computers
electronics
furniture
houses
jewelry
land
real estate
vehicles
Government agencies have these items for sale for several reasons. Some law enforcement agencies sell the seized or forfeited property of criminals. Other agencies sell items that were forfeited because of nonpayment of federal income taxes. Finally, some of the items are available because an agency surplused them and no longer needs them.
Which Agencies Host Auctions?
You can bid on items that are for sale through several websites:
Real Estate Only
Fannie Mae
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Homesales.gov
U.S. Department of Agriculture
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
Variety of Property Types
GSA Auctions
GovSales.gov
Internal Revenue Service
U.S. Department of Treasury Auctions
U.S. Marshals Service
State Auctions
Many states and even some local governments also sell surplus property. Contact your state to find if it operates an auction program.
Tips for Participating in Government Auctions
The general rule for auctions is that the highest bidder wins, and cancellation is not possible. Find out if you can cancel a bid or not.
Each auction website operates differently. In some cases, the auctions are operated completely by the government agency, while in other cases the agency really only operates the shopping site, but the actual auction is handled by a third party company.
Find out what forms of payment are accepted. There is no uniform payment policy across all the different auctions. Some auctions accept credit card payments or personal checks. Others, such as the Internal Revenue Service, don't accept these forms of payment. Cashiers checks are a widely accepted payment option.
For real estate auctions, you may need to still work with a broker or real estate agent in order to bid or make the purchase. Also, for real estate auctions, find out if financing is permitted. Many times it is not and the full purchase price is due when you win the bid.

"Homeowners and Renters Insurance","Understand the purpose of homeowners and renters insurance, what it covers, and things to consider when shopping for a policy.","Homeowners and renters insurance protect your personal property against damage or loss, and insures you in case someone gets hurt while on your property. You may already have insurance on your home if you have a mortgage on the property, because most lenders make insurance a condition of the loan.
Renters insurance, or tenant insurance, offers renters coverage similar to homeowners insurance. If you are a renter, do not assume your landlord carries insurance on your personal belongings; you may wish to purchase a separate policy.
What Can Homeowners or Renters Insurance Cover?
Homeowners or renters insurance may pay claims for:
damage to your home, garage, and other outbuildings
loss of furniture and other personal property due to damage or theft, both at home and away
additional living expenses if you rent temporary quarters while your house is being repaired
Homeowners or renters insurance may also:
include liability for bodily injury and property damage that you cause to others through negligence
include liability for accidents happening in and around your home, as well as away from home, for which you are responsible
pay for injuries occurring in and around your home to anyone other than you or your family
provide limited coverage for money, gold, jewelry, and stamp and coin collections
cover personal property in storage
What Doesn't Homeowners or Renters Insurance Cover?
Homeowners and renters insurance policies do not cover some catastrophic losses, such as those from earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods. You may be able to purchase such coverage by adding an earthquake or flood endorsement to your insurance policy, or through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
Shopping for a Policy
You may be able to save hundreds of dollars a year on homeowners or renters insurance by shopping around. You can also save money with these tips:
Consider a higher deductible. Increasing your deductible by just a few hundred dollars can make a big difference in your premium.
Ask your insurance agent about discounts. You may be able to get a lower premium if your home has safety features such as deadbolt locks, smoke detectors, an alarm system, storm shutters, or fire retardant roofing material. Persons over 55 years of age or long-term customers may also be offered discounts.
Insure your house, not the land under it. After a disaster, the land is still there. If you don't subtract the value of the land when deciding how much homeowner's insurance to buy, you will pay more than you should.
Make certain you purchase enough coverage to replace what is insured. ""Replacement"" coverage gives you the money to rebuild your home and replace its contents. An ""Actual Cash Value"" policy is cheaper but pays only what your property is worth at the time of loss, minus depreciation for age and wear.
Ask about special coverage you might need. You may have to pay extra for computers, cameras, jewelry, art, antiques, musical instruments, stamp collections, etc.
Before you purchase a renters' insurance policy, check with the landlord. The landlord may require you to carry specific limits of insurance for specific coverages. The landlord may also require you to name him/her as an additional insured on your tenant policy.
For help in deciding how much insurance coverage to buy, contact your state insurance regulator.
 
","English","Keeping Your Home Safe, Housing and Community, Insurance","DHS-Homeland","410","Homeowners and renters insurance protect your personal property against damage or loss, and insures you in case someone gets hurt while on your property. You may already have insurance on your home if you have a mortgage on the property, because most lenders make insurance a condition of the loan.
Renters insurance, or tenant insurance, offers renters coverage similar to homeowners insurance. If you are a renter, do not assume your landlord carries insurance on your personal belongings; you may wish to purchase a separate policy.
What Can Homeowners or Renters Insurance Cover?
Homeowners or renters insurance may pay claims for:
damage to your home, garage, and other outbuildings
loss of furniture and other personal property due to damage or theft, both at home and away
additional living expenses if you rent temporary quarters while your house is being repaired
Homeowners or renters insurance may also:
include liability for bodily injury and property damage that you cause to others through negligence
include liability for accidents happening in and around your home, as well as away from home, for which you are responsible
pay for injuries occurring in and around your home to anyone other than you or your family
provide limited coverage for money, gold, jewelry, and stamp and coin collections
cover personal property in storage
What Doesn't Homeowners or Renters Insurance Cover?
Homeowners and renters insurance policies do not cover some catastrophic losses, such as those from earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods. You may be able to purchase such coverage by adding an earthquake or flood endorsement to your insurance policy, or through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
Shopping for a Policy
You may be able to save hundreds of dollars a year on homeowners or renters insurance by shopping around. You can also save money with these tips:
Consider a higher deductible. Increasing your deductible by just a few hundred dollars can make a big difference in your premium.
Ask your insurance agent about discounts. You may be able to get a lower premium if your home has safety features such as deadbolt locks, smoke detectors, an alarm system, storm shutters, or fire retardant roofing material. Persons over 55 years of age or long-term customers may also be offered discounts.
Insure your house, not the land under it. After a disaster, the land is still there. If you don't subtract the value of the land when deciding how much homeowner's insurance to buy, you will pay more than you should.
Make certain you purchase enough coverage to replace what is insured. ""Replacement"" coverage gives you the money to rebuild your home and replace its contents. An ""Actual Cash Value"" policy is cheaper but pays only what your property is worth at the time of loss, minus depreciation for age and wear.
Ask about special coverage you might need. You may have to pay extra for computers, cameras, jewelry, art, antiques, musical instruments, stamp collections, etc.
Before you purchase a renters' insurance policy, check with the landlord. The landlord may require you to carry specific limits of insurance for specific coverages. The landlord may also require you to name him/her as an additional insured on your tenant policy.

"Long-Term Care","Find resources about long-term care services, common long-term care insurance questions, and how to complain about long-term care.","Long-Term Care Resources
Long-Term Care (LTC) is a variety of services that include medical and non-medical care for people who have chronic illnesses or disabilities. 
If you are thinking about long-term care needs for you or your loved one, check out the following resources:
Find local long-term care services
Assess the cost of care
Learn about legal issues to consider
Long-Term Care Insurance 
Most health insurance plans and Medicare severely limit or exclude long-term care. Read the Guide to Long-term Care Insurance. You should consider these costs as you plan for retirement. Here are some questions to ask when considering a separate long-term care insurance policy.
What qualifies you for benefits? Some insurers say you must be unable to perform a specific number of the following activities of daily living: eating, walking, getting from bed to a chair, dressing, bathing, using a toilet and remaining continent.
What type of care is covered? Does the policy cover nursing home care? What about coverage for assisted living facilities that provide less client care than a nursing home? If you want to stay in your home, will it pay for care provided by visiting nurses and therapists? What about help with food preparation and housecleaning?
What will the benefit amount be? Most plans are written to provide a specific dollar benefit per day. The benefit for home care is usually about half the nursing-home benefit. But some policies pay the same for both forms of care. Other plans pay only for your actual expenses.
What is the benefit period? It is possible to get a policy with lifetime benefits but this can be very expensive. Other options for coverage are from one to six years. The average nursing home stay is about 2.5 years.
Is the benefit adjusted for inflation? If you buy a policy prior to age 60, you face the risk that a fixed daily benefit will not be enough by the time you need it.

Is there a waiting period before benefits begin? A 20 to 100 day period is not unusual.

Complaints about Long-Term Care
To report an emergency where there is immediate danger, call 911 or contact your local authorities.
If you have a complaint about a long term-care facility, read about the long-term care ombudsman program (PDF), which investigates complaints.
If you have an elder abuse complaint, contact your long-term ombudsman or local elder abuse resources.

"Automobile Safety Information","Locate information on automobile safety.","Automobile Safety Tests
These organizations conduct automobile safety crash tests:
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA):
Conducts crash tests of new vehicles to determine the level of protection for drivers and passengers during front and side-impact crashes.  
Evaluates vehicle restraints such as air bags and safety belts. 
Conducts rollover tests to determine the likelihood of a vehicle rolling over if involved in a single-vehicle crash.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety performs a different test that uses offset-frontal car crashes to assess the protection provided by a vehicle's structure.
Safety Performance Reporting
These organizations report on or provide automobile safety information:
SaferCar.gov:
Provides information on how to file a complaint about child safety seats, tires, equipment, and vehicles
Lists vehicle and equipment defects and recalls
Lists vehicles equipped with Electronic Stability Control (ESC)

The National Motor Vehicle Title Information System provides information about a vehicle's history and condition, including information about its title, odometer reading, brand history, and, in some cases, theft.
Consumer Reports' car issue rates vehicles in terms of overall safety. Its safety score combines crash test results with a vehicle's accident avoidance factors, such as emergency handling, braking, acceleration, and driver comfort.
Note: If a vehicle has been recalled, ask your car dealer for proof that the defect has been repaired. Used vehicles should also have a current safety inspection sticker if your state requires one.

"Electoral College","Information on the electoral college. ","The Electoral College is the process used to elect the U.S President and Vice President. The process serves as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The candidate with at least 270 electoral votes wins a presidential election.   
The process begins with the selection of the electors, followed by the meeting of the electors to vote for President and Vice President, and finally the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.  
Number of Electors
Each state's number of electors is equal to the number of its U.S. Senators plus the number of its U.S. Representatives. In 48 states, when a candidate receives the majority of votes, he or she receives all of a state's electoral votes. Two states, Maine and Nebraska, can split their electoral votes among the candidates. It is possible for a candidate to receive the majority of the popular vote but not of the electoral vote and lose a presidential election.
The Office of the Federal Register coordinates the functions of the Electoral College on behalf of the Archivist of the United States, the States, the Congress, and the American people. For more information, contact them by e-mail at electoral.college@nara.gov or by phone at 1-202-741-6030.
How to Change the Electoral College
Because the Electoral College process is part of the U.S. Constitution, it would be necessary to pass a Constitutional amendment to change this system. For more information, contact your U.S. Senator or your U.S. Representative.

"Avoid foreclosure","Learn how to avoid losing your home through foreclosure when you have a financial set back.","Foreclosure is a situation in which a homeowner is unable to make mortgage payments as required, which allows the lender to seize the property, evict the homeowner and sell the home, as stipulated in the mortgage contract. 
Step one: communicate with your lender
As soon as you realize that you are going to have trouble making your mortgage payments, contact your lender and tell them about your financial difficulties.  This gives them the opportunity to work with you to create a plan.  Do not stop paying your bills, and do not wait until you cannot make payments before you act.  Though you may feel scared or embarrassed, immediately begin working with your lender to avoid foreclosure on your home.  Learn more about how to talk to your lender about trouble making payments.
Step two: work with the MHA program
You can get help through the Making Home Affordable (MHA) program, which provides free counselors for advice and assistance with keeping you in your home or getting out safely. Visit the MHA website to read about the options and what you’ll need to prepare.

"Life Insurance","Understand the purpose of life insurance and the main types of policies.","A life insurance policy is a contract between you and an insurance company. The contract states that you will pay premiums over time, and, in exchange, the company will pay a lump sum amount upon your death to a designated beneficiary. The proceeds from your life insurance policy can help pay bills and help support your surviving family members' living expenses.
There are two main types of life insurance policies:
Whole (or universal) life insurance policies are considered permanent. As long as you pay the premium, the policy is in effect. In addition to paying a benefit upon your death, whole life insurance policies also have an investment or savings component. This means that you accumulate cash value over the life of the policy, so you can borrow money from these types of policies if you need to.
Term life insurance policies are in effect for a certain period of time, or term. If you have this type of policy and pass away during the term that the policy is in effect, then the insurance company will pay a benefit. If you live past the time that the policy is in effect, the insurance company won’t pay a benefit or give you a refund. 
Term life insurance policies are usually less expensive than whole life insurance policies. This is because term life insurance policies only cover a set amount of time, while whole life insurance policies are intended to be permanent and because part of the money you pay is put away for savings.
If you have misplaced a life insurance policy, your state's insurance commission may be able to help you locate it. Or a policy locator service can search for it for a fee. If the insurance company knows that an insured person has died but can't locate the beneficiary, the company must turn the benefits over to the state's unclaimed property office.

"Vaccinization and Immunization","Get basic immunization information including schedule recommendations, programs that cover vaccine costs, and how to report an adverse reaction.","Vaccination and Immunization Basics
A vaccination is the injection of a killed or weakened organism into your body by a needle, swallowing, or inhaling. The vaccine produces immunity in the body against that organism. Immunization is the process by which you become protected from a disease.
Find information about vaccinations and immunizations from Vaccines.gov and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including a list of immunization schedules, from birth through adulthood.
Local health facilities or doctor's offices issue vaccinations. To find out which vaccinations your area offers, contact your state health department. If you're looking for vaccination information for a child, check with the child's doctor, the health department, or the child's school district for assistance. You can also use Vaccine Finder to locate a facility near you to get vaccinated.
Get the Cost of Immunizations Covered
Depending on your income, age, and health insurance coverage, you or your children may be eligible for free vaccinations.

Learn about the Vaccines for Children program.


See if your family qualifies for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).


Find out if you are eligible for Medicare or Medicaid-covered vaccinations.


Locate a local health center that can give immunizations at a cost based on your income.

 
Vaccine Injury Reporting
If you or your child experienced a serious reaction to a vaccine, you may want to report it through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Read frequently asked questions about reporting vaccine-related adverse events.
The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) monitors supplies of vaccines and vaccine costs. VICP also helps people receive compensation if a vaccination injured them.

"Marca registrada","Qué es una marca registrada, cómo registrar y renovar una marca en Estados Unidos.","Una marca registrada es una palabra, nombre, símbolo o cualquier combinación de éstos usada comercialmente para identificar sus productos o servicios, y distinguirlos de otros artículos fabricados o vendidos por otras personas.
Una marca registrada:
Indica quién fabricó el producto
Garantiza la calidad de los artículos que lleven dicha marca
Permite al dueño impedir que alguien use una marca registrada sustancialmente similar para los mismos productos o servicios
Nota: no es igual el nombre comercial que identifica a una empresa con una marca registrada que identifica un producto o servicio. 
¿Cómo y dónde establecer una marca registrada?
A nivel federal una marca se puede registrar en base a intención de buena fe para usarla en más de un estado. Sin embargo, requiere papeleo e impuestos adicionales cuando el producto o servicio sea colocado para su consumo.
Usted puede registrar su marca por Internet usando el sistema electrónico de marcas registradas (en inglés) de la Oficina de Patentes y Marcas Registradas de Estados Unidos (USPTO, sigla en inglés). Considere que el proceso para registrar una marca (en inglés) es un procedimiento legal que puede ser complejo y necesitar que usted cumpla varios requisitos dentro de un plazo limitado. Por lo tanto es recomendable consultar a un abogado antes de iniciar el proceso.
También puede informarse sobre los costos por transacción de marcas registradas (en inglés) para presentar su marca, sea electrónicamente o en papel.
Para establecer los derechos de una marca registrada en un estado específico, comuníquese con el gobierno estatal donde desea registrar su marca. Vea el directorio de agencias estatales.
¿Cómo puede averiguar el estatus de su proceso?
Usted puede ver el estatus de su aplicación por Internet en la base de datos de USPTO (en inglés).
¿Cuáles son los plazos de validez de una marca registrada?
Las marcas registradas en el Gobierno federal son válidas por diez años. Entre el quinto y sexto año, usted debe presentar una ""declaración jurada de uso"" para certificar que aún está usando la marca en el mercado. Cada diez años puede presentar una ""declaración jurada de renovación"". La validez de marcas registradas a nivel estatal varía por estado.
""TM"" versus ""SM"" versus ®
Si usted reclama derechos para usar un signo, puede usar la designación ""TM"" (sigla en inglés para marca registrada) o ""SM"" (signo de servicio) para comunicar públicamente su petición de la propiedad de dicho signo, independientemente de haber o no presentado su marca ante la USPTO.
Sin embargo, usted solo puede usar el símbolo de registro federal ""®"" después de haber terminado satisfactoriamente el proceso de registro de su marca con la USPTO.

Gather supporting documents, such as sales receipts, warranties, contracts, and work orders from the purchase. Also, print out e-mails, or logs of any contact you've had with the seller about the purchase.
Contact the seller, preferably in writing. You may be able to solve the problem by contacting a salesperson or customer service representative. If this doesn't work, contact a supervisor or manager.

"Choose a Health Insurance Plan","Understand where you can get health insurance coverage, the different types of plans, and questions to consider.","Health insurance helps you pay for medical services and sometimes prescription drugs. Once you purchase insurance coverage, you and your health insurer each agree to pay a part of your medical expenses. These amounts are usually a certain dollar amount or percentage of the expense.
You can have health care coverage through:
a group coverage plan at your job or your spouse/partner's job
your parents' insurance plan, if you are under 26 years old 
government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)

a plan you purchase on your own directly from a health insurance company or through the Health Insurance Marketplace 
Continuing Employer coverage from your former employer, on a temporary basis under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)
Types of Health Insurance Plans
When purchasing health insurance, your choices typically fall into one of three categories:
Traditional fee-for-service health insurance plans are usually the most expensive choice, but they offer you the most flexibility in choosing health care providers.
Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) offer lower co-payments and cover the costs of more preventive care, but your choice of health care providers is limited.
Preferred provider organizations (PPOs) offer lower co-payments like HMOs but give you more flexibility in selecting a provider.
Choosing a Health Insurance Plan
When choosing among different health care plans, you will need to read the fine print and ask a lot of questions, such as:
Do I have the right to go to any doctor, hospital, clinic, or pharmacy I choose?
Are specialists such as eye doctors and dentists covered?
Does the plan cover special conditions or treatments such as pregnancy, psychiatric care, and physical therapy?
Does the plan cover home care or nursing home care?
Will the plan cover all medications my physician may prescribe?
What are the deductibles? Are there any co-payments? Deductibles are the amount you must pay before your insurance company will pay a claim. These differ from co-payments, which are the amount of money you pay when you receive medical services or a prescription.

For more information, visit the AOA's pension counseling website.
Private Sector Employees
A number of federal agencies can assist you with complaints or issues regarding your pension plan:
The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) enforces the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). If you have questions or complaints about your employer-sponsored pension plan, contact your human resources office or locate the EBSA Regional Office near you.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is generally responsible for vesting, participation, and other standards of private pension plans.
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is the federal government's support for pension plans. PBGC insures only private defined-benefit pensions, not 401(k)s or other retirement plans. To see if your pension is insured, search PBGC's list of single-employer and multi-employer plans. You can also view frequently asked questions about PBGC-insured pensions.
Employers
The IRS has information to help employers determine which tax-favored pension plan best suits their needs and how to keep their plans in compliance.

An executive order is a directive by the President of the United States that has the power of a federal law.

In general, though, Presidents use executive orders to direct and manage how the federal government operates.
Can executive orders be overturned?

"Prevent and Respond to Food Poisoning ","Learn tips on how to avoid and report food poisioning.","Prevent Food Borne Illness
Each year, about one in six Americans becomes sick from food poisoning. Although most will recover without any lasting problems, some types of food poisoning can lead to kidney failure, chronic arthritis, brain and nerve damage, and even death.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list the most common food borne illnesses.
By following four simple steps, you can help to avoid food poisoning at home:
Clean: wash hands and surfaces often.
Separate: don't cross-contaminate raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs with other ready-to-eat foods.
Cook: use a food thermometer to ensure you've cooked to the right temperature.
Chill: refrigerate food within two hours of cooking and never thaw foods on the counter.
The storage and cooking temperatures of food are also important factors in keeping your food safe. Food needs to be kept at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below to keep bacteria from growing. In addition, meats should be cooked to a safe temperature-- 165 degrees Fahrenheit for poultry and 160 degrees Fahrenheit for beef. 
FoodSafety.gov is a gateway to a wealth of food safety information provided by government agencies, including the latest information about food recalls.
Respond to Food Borne Illness
If you believe someone became sick while eating a certain food:
Call 911 if they are in immediate danger.
Contact your local health department to report the food poisoning.
Ask food safety questions about meat, poultry, and processed egg products by calling the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854. Or, e-mail them at MPHotline.fsis@usda.gov.

"Landlord and Tenant Disputes","Find help if you are in a dispute with your landlord.","If you are someone who pays to rent a home or an apartment (a tenant), you may at some point have a dispute with the person who owns the building or management company that represents the owner (the landlord).  Often disputes are about the conditions of the building, essential services, rent increases, or your right to stay.  It is best to come to an agreement directly with the landlord or manager.  Make sure that you get everything in writing.

"How to get food stamps (SNAP food benefits)","How to apply for SNAP food benefits, also known as food stamps.","Food stamps are officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This federally funded program helps families put food on the table.
Learn about Food Benefits
You may be able to get money from the government that you can use to purchase food at local retailers, such as grocery stores and some farmers markets.  People often call this benefit ""food stamps"" because that's how you used to pay for food at the store. It is now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). You receive an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card to pay for food, which is similar to a credit or debit card.  The new way is easier, faster, and more discreet.  When you apply for these food benefits or receive them, you will be working with your state government.  States have different names for their food benefits program, and you'll find out what it is when you apply.  
How to Get Food Benefits
Use the pre-screening eligibility tool.  It will tell you whether you are eligible to receive food benefits and how much you would probably get.  You will still need to apply through your state's program.
Get together your income and asset information.  Your state will use information like that to figure out if you can receive benefits based on the rules of SNAP.
Find the online application for your state. You'll find local office addresses and phone numbers in the same place.  You can also apply in person, sometimes at a state office or with the help of people from a program that has partnered with your state to make sure everyone gets the food benefits they need.
Wait to learn if you are eligible for benefits. If your state determines that you are someone who can receive food benefits, they will send you an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card.
Use your EBT card to access food benefits at your local authorized SNAP retailers. You can use the card at a cash register like a credit or debit card to pay for food.
Many states have EBT websites set up for managing your benefits. If your state is not listed, contact your state SNAP or local office.
You may be eligible to receive other government benefits.  Visit Benefits.gov to learn more.

"Organic Food","Find out what makes food organic and how to report if food is falsely advertised as organic.","The National Organic Program (NOP) governs all aspects of organic food production, processing, delivery, and retail sale. In general, the NOP allows all natural substances in organic production and prohibits all synthetic substances.
What is organic food
Buying organic food is a way to eat in a healthy manner and protect the environment. These foods are grown and processed according to U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA organic standards and regulations and follow specific rules concerning pest control, raising animals, and the use of additives. Keep in mind that organic and natural foods tend to be more expensive than conventionally grown foods, and that the USDA does not claim that organic food is safer or more nutritious than other foods.
How to check if it's organic
To make sure a product is certified organic, look for the USDA organic seal. You can also tell whether produce was grown organically by checking the price look up code (PLU); if the first number starts with a 4, then the food was grown conventionally, if it starts with a 9, it was grown organically.
Other common labels that help you choose certain types of organic food products include:
Free-Range or Cage-Free: The flock was provided shelter in a building, room, or area with unlimited access to food, fresh water, and the outdoors during its production cycle.
Natural: As required by USDA, meat, poultry, and egg products labeled as “natural” must be minimally processed and contain no artificial ingredients.
Grass-Fed: Grass-fed animals receive a majority of their nutrients from grass throughout their life, while organic animals’ pasture diet may be supplemented with grain.
How to File Complaint
If you think their is an organic food that is not meeting USDA standards, you can:
FIle a complaint.
Who to Contact
If you need more information about organic food:
Call the National Organic Program at 1-202-720-3252.

Some states do not allow cash lotteries but allow charities to raffle off prizes for fundraising purposes. Other states consider a lottery and a raffle the same thing and do not permit either one. In the United States, 43 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have lotteries.

"Beware: Lottery and Sweepstakes Scams","Know the signs to look out for to determine if lotteries and sweepstakes are legitimate.","Not all lotteries and sweepstakes are legitimate. Before you participate, keep these tips in mind:
Scam artists often use the promise of a valuable prize or award to entice consumers to send money, buy overpriced products or services, or contribute to bogus charities.
Legitimate sweepstakes don't require you to pay to collect your winnings.
Scam operators use the telephone and direct mail to entice U.S. consumers to buy chances in foreign lotteries from as far away as Australia and Europe. These lottery solicitations violate U.S. law, which prohibits the cross-border sale or purchase of lottery tickets by phone or mail.

"Know How to File Complaints about Banks and Credit Products","Explains how to file a complaint with a financial institution, and which government agencies to contact.","If you have a problem with your bank, financial institution, lender, broker, or any other financial service provider, you should report it. To guide you through the process of filing these types of complaints, the Federal Reserve offers the following tips:
First, try to resolve it with the manager at the branch location, the customer service hotline, or the institution's website.
When filing your complaint, clearly explain your problem and how you would like it to be resolved.
Be sure to have copies of receipts, checks, or other proof of the transaction.
If you don't get your problem resolved using these steps, you have the right to get help from the correct regulatory agency.
Complaints About Deposit Accounts
Financial institutions are regulated by different government agencies, depending on how the institution was chartered.
Use the Federal Reserve System's financial institution search tool to find out which agency accepts complaints about the financial institution you need to file a complaint against. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation offers the contact information for the primary federal agencies that regulate financial institutions.
To file a complaint about a national bank (those with National in their names, or N.A. after their name), contact the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. This agency also receives complaints for federal savings and loans and federal savings banks.
For a problem with a state-chartered bank and trust company, contact either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or state banking authority.
To file a complaint about a federally chartered credit union, contact the National Credit Union Administration.
For a problem with a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, contact the Federal Reserve System.
Complaints About Other Financial Services
Maybe your problem doesn't involve a traditional bank or credit union or related to bank accounts or fees, but is related to credit or other financial services. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigates complaints involving loan products, such as mortgage companies, car loans and leases, student loans, payday loans, and any other consumer loans. This agency also accepts complaints about other financial services, such as credit cards, prepaid cards, money transfers, and debt collection.
If you need to file a complaint about an investment, such as a fraud, pyramid scheme, or other violation of federal securities laws, submit your problem to the Securities and Exchange Commission. You may also submit a complaint with your state's securities regulator.

"Ley Estadounidense de Alivio a los Contribuyentes","Conozca qué impacto tiene la ley tributaria de 2013 en la declaración de sus impuestos.","¿Qué impacto tiene la Ley Estadounidense de Alivio a los Contribuyentes en la declaración de sus impuestos?
El 2 de enero de 2013 el presidente Barack Obama aprobó la Ley Estadounidense de Alivio a los Contribuyentes (ATRA, sigla en inglés). Esta nueva ley resuelve varios asuntos tributarios que fueron discutidos por el Congreso a finales de 2012, también conocido como ""abismo fiscal"".
Conozca los asuntos fiscales acordados en esta ley y cómo podrían afectarlo:
Las ""reducciones de impuestos de la era Bush""
La nueva ley extiende permanentemente la reducción de las tasas de impuesto sobre ingreso y ganancias de capital y dividendos si usted gana menos de 400,000 dólares (450,000 dólares si está casado y presenta una declaración conjunta). Si gana una cantidad mayor, la tasa impositiva marginal para ingresos correspondiente ha sido aumentada de 35 por ciento al 39.6 por ciento.
Este cambio también aumentó la tasa impositiva superior sobre ganancias de capital y dividendos a largo plazo del 15 por ciento al 20 por ciento, y causó modificaciones en varios otros créditos fiscales, la llamada ""penalidad matrimonial"" y los incentivos relacionados con la educación.
Las reglas de impuesto sobre la herencia
ATRA extiende permanentemente las leyes de impuesto sobre la herencia tal como existen actualmente, excepto la tasa impositiva superior que fue aumentada del 35 por ciento al 40 por ciento. Continúan exentos de impuestos las herencias de hasta 5 millones de dólares.
Provisiones fiscales de la Ley de Recuperación y Reinversión Estadounidense de 2009
Los siguientes créditos tributarios fueron extendidos temporalmente hasta 2017-el crédito tributario por hijo, algunas provisiones alrededor del Crédito por Ingreso del Trabajo y el Crédito de la Oportunidad Estadounidense (un crédito tributario para la educación).
La reducción de impuesto sobre la nómina
En 2010, el Congreso aprobó una reducción de 2 por ciento en la cantidad de dinero a contribuir a través del impuesto sobre la nómina del Seguro Social. Esta reducción de impuesto no fue extendida como parte de ATRA. Por lo tanto, esta tasa tributable ha sido revertida a la cantidad original de 6.2 por ciento para empleados y de 12.4 por ciento para trabajadores independientes. Usted podría notar un cambio en su primer pago de 2013.
ATRA también abordó varios asuntos más, incluyendo desempleo, Medicare y otras provisiones de salud, y la ley agrícola.

"Tax Refund Reductions","Understand how the government can collect on delinquent debts, by making deductions from your federal tax refund.","How it Works
If you owe money to a federal or state agency (including past-due child support), the federal government may deduct your debts from your federal tax refund. Known as the Treasury Offset Program, the Bureau of Fiscal Service (BFS) collects such delinquent debts (typically more than 90 days overdue) on behalf of other federal and state government agencies.
BFS will cross check your name and taxpayer information against its delinquent debtor database. If there is a match, BFS will notify you that it is deducting the amount you owe from the payment you were going to receive. BFS will send the outstanding amount to the federal or state government agency to which you owed the money. If you owe more money than the payment you were going to receive, then BFS will send the entire amount to the other government agency. If you owe less, BFS will send the agency the amount you owed, and then send you the remaining balance.
For example, if you were going to receive a $1,500 federal tax refund, but you have been delinquent on a student loan and have $1,000 outstanding, BFS will deduct $1,000 from your tax refund and send it to the U.S. Department of Education. It will also send you a notice of its action, along with the remaining $500 that was due to you as a tax refund.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides helpful tips to help you understand tax refund offsets. If you believe that a deduction was made in error, you should contact the agency that said you owed money, not the IRS. If you have questions about this program, check out the frequently asked questions or contact the Bureau of Fiscal Service.

"Know Your Rights with Warranties","Find out what a warranty is, who issues them, and access in-depth information on these topics from the Federal Trade Commission.","A warranty is the promise that a manufacturer or seller makes to stand behind a product's quality. Federal law requires that warranties be available for you to read before you buy, even when you are shopping by catalog or on the Internet, so that you can comparison shop. A standard warranty is part of the item you purchased, and there is no additional cost for this protection from the company. There are three main types of warranties:
Written warranties are printed and come along with the item you purchased. In order for a written warranty to take effect or to make a claim against it, the seller or manufacturer may require you to perform maintenance or that you use the item as instructed.
Spoken warranties are spoken by a salesperson, or other staff at a retailer or service provider, for services like free repairs. If you receive this kind of warranty, have the person who gave it and their manager put it in writing. Otherwise, you may not be able to get the service that was promised to you.
Implied warranties promise that the item you purchased will do what it is supposed to do and that it can work under the circumstances that it was designed for. These warranties are created by state laws, and are not specifically stated or written.
If you purchase an item and it doesn't have a written warranty, it is still covered under the implicit warranty laws in your state, unless it was marked ""as is"" when you purchased it.
Service Contracts
Service contracts or “extended warranties” extend the guarantee or promise that a product will work, and are purchased for an additional cost. Sellers offer these service contracts at the time of purchase, and sometimes months or years after your purchase. They are commonly offered when you buy a car, major electronics, or household appliances. Third party firms (not the manufacturer or the seller) may also try to sell you a extended warranty; some even make cold calls to you with high pressure sales tactics. Some extended warranties duplicate the warranty coverage that you get automatically from a manufacturer or seller. These add-ons may not be worth the cost. Ask these questions before you agree to one of these contracts:
Does the dealer, the manufacturer, or an independent company back the service contract?
How are claims handled? Who will do the work and where it will be done?
What happens to your coverage if the dealer or administrator goes out of business?
Do you need prior authorization for repair work?
Are there any situations when coverage can be denied? You may not have protection from common wear and tear. And some manufacturers do not honor contracts if you fail to follow their recommendations for routine maintenance.
Problems with Warranties
If you have problems receiving the services that were promised in your warranty, you can report your dispute. First read your warranty to make sure you know your rights. Then you can file a complaint with the retailer; if the retailer can't help, contact the manufacturer. If neither the retailer or manufacturer can help, file a complaint with your local consumer protection agency.
","English","Smart Spending","FTC","148","A warranty is the promise that a manufacturer or seller makes to stand behind a product's quality. Federal law requires that warranties be available for you to read before you buy, even when you are shopping by catalog or on the Internet, so that you can comparison shop. A standard warranty is part of the item you purchased, and there is no additional cost for this protection from the company. There are three main types of warranties:
Written warranties are printed and come along with the item you purchased. In order for a written warranty to take effect or to make a claim against it, the seller or manufacturer may require you to perform maintenance or that you use the item as instructed.
Spoken warranties are spoken by a salesperson, or other staff at a retailer or service provider, for services like free repairs. If you receive this kind of warranty, have the person who gave it and their manager put it in writing. Otherwise, you may not be able to get the service that was promised to you.
Implied warranties promise that the item you purchased will do what it is supposed to do and that it can work under the circumstances that it was designed for. These warranties are created by state laws, and are not specifically stated or written.
If you purchase an item and it doesn't have a written warranty, it is still covered under the implicit warranty laws in your state, unless it was marked ""as is"" when you purchased it.
Service Contracts
Service contracts or “extended warranties” extend the guarantee or promise that a product will work, and are purchased for an additional cost. Sellers offer these service contracts at the time of purchase, and sometimes months or years after your purchase. They are commonly offered when you buy a car, major electronics, or household appliances. Third party firms (not the manufacturer or the seller) may also try to sell you a extended warranty; some even make cold calls to you with high pressure sales tactics. Some extended warranties duplicate the warranty coverage that you get automatically from a manufacturer or seller. These add-ons may not be worth the cost. Ask these questions before you agree to one of these contracts:
Does the dealer, the manufacturer, or an independent company back the service contract?
How are claims handled? Who will do the work and where it will be done?
What happens to your coverage if the dealer or administrator goes out of business?
Do you need prior authorization for repair work?
Are there any situations when coverage can be denied? You may not have protection from common wear and tear. And some manufacturers do not honor contracts if you fail to follow their recommendations for routine maintenance.

"Renewable Energy Resources","Find information on various types of renewable energy and advanced vehicles and fuels. ","Renewable energy resources are constantly replenished and will never run out. The main sources of renewable energy include:
Biomass energy uses energy from plants and plant-derived materials, with wood being the largest resource used.
Geothermal energy uses the heat from the earth via steam reservoirs, geothermal reservoirs and the shallow ground near the Earth's surface.
Hydrogen energy uses hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel, and combines it with oxygen in a fuel cell, which produces heat and electricity with only water vapor as a by-product.
Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, occurs when flowing water is captured and turned into electricity.
Ocean energy uses heat energy stored in the Earth's oceans to generate electricity. through a process called ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC).
Solar energy uses the sun as a powerful source of energy.
Wind energy uses a wind turbine to generate electricity.
Advanced Vehicles and Fuels
Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are helping the nation to reduce fuel costs and usage and improve the environment by developing transportation technologies like these:
Fuel Cell Vehicles are powered by hydrogen fuel and produce no harmful tailpipe exhaust—their only emission is water.  
Hybrid Electric Vehicles are powered by an internal combustion engine or other propulsion source that can be run on conventional or alternative fuel and an electric motor that uses energy stored in a battery. 
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) use batteries to power an electric motor and use another fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, to power an internal combustion engine or other propulsion source.

"Deal with a Defective Car","Identify the factors that matter in determining if a car is a ""lemon"" and how to get your problem resolved.","Most states have some form of a ""lemon"" law to protect car buyers in situations where they have purchased a vehicle that is defective beyond repair. These laws tend to only apply to new cars, but you should check with your state's consumer protection office to see if they also cover used cars. Each state has its own ""lemon"" law requirements, but overall the ability for a car to qualify as a ""lemon"" depends on a few things:
Number of miles driven—The defects had to happen within a certain number of months or miles driven.
Substantial defects—Defects have to be substantial, and involve the actual operation of the car, such as the ignitition, brakes, engine, transmission, or other major parts of the car.
Reasonable repair attempts—You have to give mechanics multiple chances to repair the problems.
Number of days in the shop—Your car has to have been in the mechanic's shop for a significant number of days, (generally 30 days or more) within a year.
To get your problem resolved, first contact the car manufacturer. Send the manufacturer a certified letter detailing the problems, copies of work orders and invoices, and your request for a refund or other solution. If the manufacturer doesn’t help, you still may be able to resolve the problem. Many car contracts have mandatory arbitration clauses so that may be your next step.

"Protect Yourself when You Rent a Car","Learn about what steps you should take and questions you should ask when you are renting a car.","When you rent a car, you are using another company's car for a short period of time. This option can be convenient if your car is in the shop or when visiting another city. However, there are several factors to consider before you sign the rental agreement:
Ask what the total cost will be after all fees are included. There may be an airport surcharge or drop-off fees, insurance fees, fuel charges, mileage fees, taxes, additional-driver fees, under aged-driver fees, and equipment rental fees (for items such as ski racks and car seats).
Ask whether the rental company checks the driving records of customers when they arrive at the service counter. If so, you could be turned away even if you have a confirmed reservation.
Check in advance to be sure you aren't duplicating insurance coverage. If you're traveling on business, your employer might have insurance that covers accidental damage to the vehicle. You might also have coverage through your personal auto insurance, a motor club membership, or the credit card you used to reserve the rental.
Carefully inspect the vehicle and its tires before renting and when you return it. Try to return the car during regular business hours so you and the rental staff can look at the car together to verify that you didn't damage it.
Check refueling policies and charges. Some rental companies, particularly at airports, may require you to refuel within a 10 mile radius of the airport or show a fuel receipt when you return the car.
Pay with a credit card rather than a debit card, to avoid holds on other funds in your checking account.
Ask the rental company if a deposit is required. If so, ask for a clear explanation of the deposit refund procedures.
Visit the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for more information about renting a car and the insurance options.

This option can be convenient if your car is in the shop or when visiting another city. However, there are several factors to consider before you sign the rental agreement:
Ask what the total cost will be after all fees are included. There may be an airport surcharge or drop-off fees, insurance fees, fuel charges, mileage fees, taxes, additional-driver fees, under aged-driver fees, and equipment rental fees (for items such as ski racks and car seats).
Ask whether the rental company checks the driving records of customers when they arrive at the service counter. If so, you could be turned away even if you have a confirmed reservation.
Check in advance to be sure you aren't duplicating insurance coverage. If you're traveling on business, your employer might have insurance that covers accidental damage to the vehicle. You might also have coverage through your personal auto insurance, a motor club membership, or the credit card you used to reserve the rental.
Carefully inspect the vehicle and its tires before renting and when you return it. Try to return the car during regular business hours so you and the rental staff can look at the car together to verify that you didn't damage it.
Check refueling policies and charges. Some rental companies, particularly at airports, may require you to refuel within a 10 mile radius of the airport or show a fuel receipt when you return the car.
Pay with a credit card rather than a debit card, to avoid holds on other funds in your checking account.
Ask the rental company if a deposit is required. If so, ask for a clear explanation of the deposit refund procedures.
Visit the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for more information about renting a car and the insurance options.

"Buy a Used Car","Learn what actions you should take before buying a used car.","If you are buying a used car, you should consider these factors to protect yourself from buying a defective car.
Learn what rights you have when buying a used car. Contact your state or local consumer protection office.
Find out in advance what paperwork you will need to register a vehicle. Contact your state motor vehicle department.
Check prices of similar models using the NADA Official Used Car Guide published by the National Automobile Dealer Association, or the Kelley Blue Book. These guides are usually available at local libraries.
Research the vehicle's history. Ask the seller for details concerning past owners, use, and maintenance. You should also find out whether the car has been damaged in a flood, involved in a crash, been labeled a ""lemon"" or had its odometer rolled back. The vehicle identification number (VIN) will help you do this. Also visit Vehiclehistory.gov to buy vehicle history reports gathered from state motor vehicle departments and other sources. These reports are helpful, but do not guarantee that a vehicle is accident-free.
Your state motor vehicle department can research the car's title history.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) lets you search an online database of recalls, investigations, and complaints.
The Center for Auto Safety provides information on safety defects, recalls, and lemons, as well as technical service bulletins.
Make sure any mileage disclosures match the odometer reading on the car.
Check the warranty. If a manufacturer's warranty is still in effect, contact the manufacturer to make sure you can use the coverage.
Ask about the dealer's return policy. Get it in writing and read it carefully.
Have the car inspected by your mechanic. Talk to the seller and agree in advance that you'll pay for the examination if the car passes inspection, but the seller will pay if significant problems are discovered. A qualified mechanic should check the vehicle's frame, tires, air bags and undercarriage, as well as the engine.
Examine dealer documents carefully. Make sure you are buying—not leasing—the vehicle. Leases use terms such as ""balloon payment"" and ""base mileage"" disclosures.

"Research Before You Decide to Lease","Consider these factors to determine if a car lease is the best choice for you.","When you lease, you pay to drive someone else's vehicle. Monthly lease payments may be lower than loan payments, but at the end of the lease you have no ownership or equity in the car. To get the best deal, follow the advice below in addition to the general suggestions for buying a car.
To help you compare leasing versus owning, the Consumer Leasing Act requires leasing companies to give you information on monthly payments and other charges.
Shop around to compare lease offers from multiple dealers.
Find out what the down payment, or capitalized cost reduction, is for the lease. Consumers with better credit scores qualify for the low down payments and rates that are advertised in commercials.
Calculate the total cost over the life of the lease, and include the down payment. A lease with a higher down payment and low monthly payments may be a better deal for you.
Consider using an independent agent rather than the dealer. You might find a better deal. Most financial institutions that offer auto financing also offer leasing options.
Ask for details on wear and tear limits. Dings that you regard as normal wear and tear could be billed as significant damage at the end of your lease.
Find out how many miles you can drive in a year. Most leases allow 12,000 to 15,000 miles a year. Expect a charge of 10 to 25 cents for each additional mile driven.
Check the manufacturer's warranty. It should cover the entire lease term and the number of miles you are likely to drive.
Ask the dealer what happens if you give up the car before the end of your lease. You are responsible for any early termination charges if you end the lease early.
Ask what happens if the car is involved in an accident.
Get all the terms in writing. Everything included with the car should be listed on the lease to avoid being charged for ""missing"" equipment later.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board offer more information to help you decide if leasing is the right choice for you.

"Consider These Tips Before You Buy a New Car","Tips for buying a new car.","Whether you are buying or leasing a new car, consider these tips to get the best deal and avoid problems:
Check out different car makes and models. Do your research first and compare vehicles. You can go to the website of every car manufacturer and review every model of car available. In fact, many manufacturer websites will even let you use drop down menus to “build” an electronic version of your dream car. Then, when you decide which model, colors, and accessories you want, you can use the website to locate a dealer and find the closest showroom that has the cars you like.
Research the dealer’s price for the car and options. It’s easier to get the best price when you know what the dealer paid for a vehicle. The dealer invoice price is available at a number of websites and in printed pricing guides. Try to locate the wholesale price—this figure factors in dealer incentives from a manufacturer, and is a more accurate estimate of what a dealer is paying for a car.
Find out if the manufacturer is offering rebates that will lower the cost.
Get price quotes from several dealers. Find out if the amounts quoted are the prices before or after rebates are deducted.
Avoid low-value extras such as credit insurance, auto club memberships, extended warranties, rust proofing, and upholstery finishes. You do not have to purchase credit insurance to get a loan.
Hybrid-electric cars are popular among consumers interested in fuel economy and reducing their negative impact on the environment. These cars combine the benefits of gasoline engines and electric motors, and can be configured to achieve different objectives such as improved fuel economy, increased power, or additional auxiliary power. Also look for the Smartway logo to identify cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars and trucks. Fueleconomy.gov has more information about hybrids, electric vehicles, and alternative fuels.

Most plans cover dogs and cats, and some plans cover other types of animals.
What to Consider Before Buying Pet Health Insurance
Shop and compare:  Ask your vet to recommend some pet insurers. Be aware that policies and premiums vary widely. Compare monthly or annual costs, and the differences in deductibles, co-pays, and coverage limits. These may limit payouts by incident, annually, or your animal's lifetime.
Carefully read policies:  Read the clauses on deductibles, co-pays, coverage limits, and exclusions before you buy a pet insurance policy. Insurance policies normally exclude pre-existing problems and hereditary conditions such as dysphasia in certain dog breeds, such as German shepherds and retrievers.
Do your math:  Make sure you add up the total costs of the policy for the anticipated life expectancy of your pet. Be aware that the age of your pet affects the premium. The older your pet is, the higher the premium you'll pay.
Questions to Ask Insurers
Can I choose my vet?
Is there a waiting period?
Do you cover routine wellness exams?
Do you cover neutering or spaying?
Does the plan include prescription drug coverage?
Do you cover claims annually or by incident?
If the coverage is by incident, is there a time limit?
Is there a dollar limit for vet office fees?
If my pet has a pre-existing or hereditary condition, will this plan cover it?
Does this plan cover chronic or recurring conditions?
How long do you take to pay claims?
Do you give discounts for insuring multiple pets?
Does this plan cover advertising costs and rewards if my pet is lost or stolen?
Does this plan make payouts if my pet dies during treatment?

"No Downpayment Mortgage for Disaster Survivors","Section 203(h) program allows the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to insure mortgages made by qualified lenders to victims of a major disaster.","If you lost your home due to a major disaster, you may qualify for an insured mortgage. You can use an insured mortgage to finance the purchase or reconstruction of a single family home that will be your principal residence.
The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Section 203(h) program offers features that make recovery from a disaster easier for homeowners:
No downpayment is required. You must pay closing costs and prepaid expenses in cash or through premium pricing. Or the seller can pay them, subject to a 6 percent seller concessions limit.
FHA mortgage insurance is not free. Lenders collect from the borrowers an up-front insurance premium (which may be financed) at the time of purchase, as well as monthly premiums that are not financed, but instead are added to the regular mortgage payment.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) sets limits on the amount that may be insured. FHA sets limits on the dollar value of the mortgage, to make sure that its programs serve low and moderate income people. You can view the current FHA mortgage limits online. These figures vary over time and by place, depending on the cost of living and other factors (higher limits also exist for two to four family properties).

"Credit Reports","Find out why credit reports are important and learn how to get a free annual credit report.","Credit reports contain information about your bill payment history, loans, current debt, and other financial information. They show where you work and live and whether you've been sued, arrested, or filed for bankruptcy. 
Credit reports help lenders decide whether or not to extend you credit or approve a loan, and what interest rate they will charge you. Prospective employers, insurers, and rental property owners may also look at your credit report.
It's important to check your credit report regularly to ensure that your personal information and financial accounts are being accurately reported and that no fraudulent accounts have been opened in your name. If you find errors on your credit report, take steps to have them corrected.

"Labor Unions","Learn how to start or stop union representation at your workplace, and how to file a complaint about a union.","A labor union or trade union is an organization of workers. The union bargains with employers on behalf of union members and negotiates labor contracts. This may include negotiating pay and benefits; work rules; complaint procedures; rules about hiring, firing, and promoting workers; workplace safety; and other policies. The agreements union leaders negotiate are binding on the union members, the employer, and in some cases on other non-member workers.
Private Sector Employees
If you work in the private sector and want a union to represent you at your workplace, or if you no longer wish a union to continue representing you, you must start by filing a petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). In order to file a petition with the NLRB, you must show that the petition has the support of at least 30 percent of your fellow employees. The NLRB will then conduct a government-sponsored election. If a union receives a majority of the votes, the NLRB certifies it as the employees' bargaining representative. The employer must recognize the union as the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees in the unit. Failure to bargain with the union, at this point, is an unfair labor practice.
File a Labor Union Complaint
If you aren't a federal, state, or local government employee, and you have a complaint pertaining to a union, contact your nearest NLRB regional office.
For federal employees, if you have questions or complaints about federal unions, please contact the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA).
For employees of state or local government, if you have an issue regarding the rights and obligations of unions, you may wish to contact the Information Officer of the NLRB regional office closest to your job. They will then refer you to the state or local government agency, if any, which regulates labor relations issues involving state and local government employees.
Please note: The NLRB does not handle complaints about federal, state, and local government unions. In addition, the NLRB does not handle complaints or inquiries about certain other forms of employment discrimination, such as that based on race or sex, or issues regarding workplace safety, entitlement to overtime pay, or family and medical leave. Federal and state statutes and agencies regulate those forms of employment discrimination. Please visit the related agencies section of NLRB's website to identify which agency can best assist you with your complaint.

"Understand Changes in Gas Prices","Understand the factors that cause differences in gas prices, nationally, regionally, and locally.","Have you ever wondered why gas prices at your local gas station change over the months, or why the price of gas in your city is different from prices across the country? Several factors affect the price you pay at the pump for gas.
Crude Oil Prices
The biggest factor that impacts gas prices is the price of crude oil. Crude oil is the main ingredient for the gas that you use in cars. People around the world need crude oil for their transportation needs, but there is a limited supply available. When the demand for this oil increases or if there is a shortage in the amount available (due to natural disasters or political unrest in the areas that produce the oil), then the price of fuel for your car may also increase.
Refineries and Transportation
After companies drill for crude oil, they refine it or put it through several chemical processes so that it can be turned into fuel for your car. The refined crude oil is then transported to each region of the country through pipelines and tanker trucks. The refining and transporting costs are passed on to you.
Many oil refineries are in the southern part of the U.S., near the Gulf of Mexico. Since it costs more to transport the fuel farther distances, the gas prices in the states that are farther away may be higher than the gas prices in states that are closer to the refineries.
Seasonality
In the late spring and summer months, there are more steps involved in the refining of the crude oil that makes it more expensive. The higher costs of refining often lead to higher gas prices, especially in the summer. Some states also require additional chemicals to be included in the fuel that is sold in their state, to protect the environment. The cost of adding these ingredients during the refining process may cause the price of gas to be higher in those states.
Taxes
Taxes also affect the cost of gas. The price per gallon of gas includes taxes from federal, state, county and city governments. There can be differences in gas prices because of the state and local taxes.
Local Factors
There are also price differences because of local factors. In areas with few gas stations, gas prices tend to be more expensive than in areas with several stations nearby. Each gas station operator is responsible for paying rental costs, franchising fees, staff salaries, and other business expenses. The difference in these business costs can be the cause of the price differences between stations, even if they are near each other. You may also pay lower prices at some stations, if they sponsor loyalty programs or cents off of the gallon promotions, often with local grocery retailers. You may also pay lower prices at some stations by paying with cash instead of a debit or credit card.  Find the lowest gas prices in your area, using Fueleconomy.gov's gas price tool.

Some private companies also use security clearances to protect such things as intellectual property rights and financial information. Most of these companies use a background check, which usually researches work, criminal, and credit history.
